@inproceedings{ieee6020921,
	abstract = "Increased use of electronic communication has given birth to new ways of transmitting information securely. Audio steganography is the science of hiding some secret text or audio information in a host message. The host message before steganography and stego message after steganography have the same characteristics. Least Significant Bit (LSB) modification technique is the most simple and efficient technique used for audio steganography. The conventional LSB modification technique is vulnerable to steganalysis. This paper proposes two ways to improve the conventional LSB modification technique. The first way is to randomize bit number of host message used for embedding secret message while the second way is to randomize sample number containing next secret message bit. The improvised proposed technique works against steganalysis and decreases the probability of secret message being extracted by an intruder. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 256 bits key length is used to secure secret message in case the steganography technique breaks. Proposed technique has been tested successfully on a. wav file at a sampling frequency of 8000 samples/second with each sample containing 8 bits.",

	abstract = "In this work, we increased the capacity of the classic LSB insertion method by performing the embedding process in the wavelet domain. The algorithm uses perfect reconstruction filterbanks and embeds additional information inside wavelet domain of audio signal by modifying LSB values of wavelet coefficients. Objective and subjective tests show large advantage of the proposed method over time insertion method. For the same SNR values, proposed algorithm outperforms classical LSB algorithm by 150-200 kbps of hidden data. Subjective experiments showed that wavelet domain information hiding scheme is acoustically more transparent as well.",

	abstract = "Steganography is the art of hiding information in a cover media without attracting attention. One of the cover media which can be used for steganography is speech. In this paper, we propose a new speech steganography in wavelet domain. In this method, lifting scheme is used to create perfect reconstruction Int2Int wavelets. The data is hidden in some of the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of detail wavelet coefficients. The LSB bits for hiding are selected with a new adaptive algorithm. This algorithm does not hide information in silent parts, so there is no need for silent detection algorithms. This method has zero error in hiding/unhiding process, while normal wavelet domain LSB has about 0.2 \% error in equal hiding capacity. This method is a high capacity steganography method which can hide information up to 20\% of the input speech. The Signal-to- Noise Ratio (SNR) and listening tests show that the stegano audio is imperceptible from original audio.",
